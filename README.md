# File-Manager
An Open Source File Management Application

This file manager project is part of the Ship-In-30 project from [David's Developer Safeplace](https://discord.gg/devsafeplace) Discord server.

## Features
Throughout the next 30 days, we as a team aim to add the following:

- [ ] Basic file management (as a file manager would have :P)
- [ ] An original yet interesting way to visualise storage space on a drive
- [ ] A sleek, creative, and helpful user interface to make managing your storage much more efficient
- [ ] A way to protect your valuable file contents with passwords and encryption

## Tech Stack

This project uses React Native to interface managament of files, using Typescript for general functionality.


## Contribution

This project uses a 3 legged branching strategy with `main` being the production version of the code; Main reflects the current version that is currently live to the public. The `development` branch contains the active changes that are made by the engineers to implement new features or fixes; pull requests are needed to contribute into `development` with 2 approvals from other engineers.

When you are contributing to the project, you will need to create a new branch based off of the `development` branch. Please format the branch with a prefix and a name that best describes the type of change being implemented these contain:

- `feature/`(New feature branches)
- `fix/` (Fixes for branches)
- `task/`(Generic branches for mundane tasks, such as updating a lang file or dependencies)

Once you have selected the branch type please create a branch name as a suffix. For example, if you had a branch that implemented a login button on the home page you would call it `feature/home-page-login-button`

Upon completing your changes **that are tested**, please raise a pull request that merges **into development**, fill out the template and drop a link to the pull request in the "Ship-In-30" [discussion](https://discord.com/channels/368853404723707914/1073307477405335592) channel. Upon review and approval your changes will be submitted into the development branch. Then once the version is ready, it is released into production.
