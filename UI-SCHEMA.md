# **FOLDER STRUCTURE FOR MAESTRO UI** 

## 📁assets - Commonly used to store static files and resources that are used in the application. (Image, Icons, Fonts, etc.)
<br>
<br>

## 📁 components - Reusable UI components that are used to build the front end of the application. These components are designed to be self-contained and independent of the specific screen or functionality they are used in. (Home page components, File page components, Upload page components)
<br>
<br>

## 📁 shared - Typically contains files that are not specific to a particular feature or component but are meant to be used by multiple components, screens, or modules. (Loading screen, Navbar component, Custom Hooks, etc.)
<br>
<br>

## 📁 views - Used to store the different screens or views of the application. Each file within the "views" folder represents a specific screen or a logical section of the user interface. (e.g Home page, Files page, Upload page, etc.)
<br>
<br>

## 📁 layouts  - The files within the "layouts" folder typically handle the arrangement and positioning of UI elements, providing a consistent structure across different screens or views. (Sidebar, Title logo)
<br>
<br>

## 📁 utils - "utils" folder is commonly used to store utility functions and helper modules that provide common functionality and assist in various tasks across the application. (Getting file extension, checking file size, file formatting)
